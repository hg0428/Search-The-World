Some of its main implementation features include sum types, iterators, list comprehensions, and quantifiers.  Example  primes = n in (from 2 ) where  for  all p in (range 2 n)        n % p != 0   Build  Just type in the following:  git clone https://github.com/curly-lang/curly-lang &&  cd curly-lang && cargo build  This project depends on either clang or gcc for compiling, which can each be installed using your favourite package manager ( apt / pacman / dnf for Linux and Homebrew/MacPorts for macOS).  Note: This repo has only been tested on Arch Linux, but should work on all other platforms rust supports without much issue.  Progress  See TODO.md. Everything is highly experimental. Be cautious: code may be explosive.  Support  Come to the official discord server!          About  The Curly programming language (now in Rust!)
