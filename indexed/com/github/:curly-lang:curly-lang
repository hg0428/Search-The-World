Some of its main implementation features include sum types, iterators, list comprehensions, and quantifiers.  Example  module  Main fib =  let  fib_tail  a : Int, b: Int, n: Int =  if n ==  0  then a else fib_tail b (a + b) (n -  1 ) in fib_tail 0  1 main = debug $ fib 50   Build  Just type in the following:  git clone https://github.com/curly-lang/curly-lang &&  cd curly-lang && cargo build  This project depends on gcc for compiling, which can be installed using your favourite package manager ( apt / pacman / dnf for Linux and Homebrew/MacPorts for macOS (note: clang is currently unsupported, so you must install gcc on macos)).  Note: This repo has only been tested on Arch Linux, but should work on all other platforms rust supports without much issue.  Progress  See TODO.md. Everything is highly experimental.
