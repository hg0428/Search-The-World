It aims to be simple, small, fast , extendable and embeddable .  Build  Download the source  You might just want the minimum to start with, try  git clone https://github.com/Gwion/Gwion cd Gwiongit submodule update --initmake  Configuring (optional)  You can get a list of config files to tweak with  find . -name " config.mk "  Please rebuild to take your change into account.  make -C util cleanmake -C ast  cleanmake cleanmake   Besides developer options, you migth want to check USE_DOUBLE , in util/config.mk, which set the floating point size (float or double).Note that the option you choose must match how you built your soundpipe library (more on soundpipe later).   Executing your first code (hello_world.gw):  This assumes you have successfully compiled gwion. To build follow these steps . To check, if the build was successfully run  ./gwion  if this gives out some error, there were problems with your compilation.Try building again, and open a issue if the problem persists. We would love to help you out. If you see no errors, Congratulations!! You have successfully compiled gwion, and can move ahead.  Create a new file "hello_world.gw" in the same directory.(You are free to use any command)  touch hello_world.gw  Open this file using your favourite text editor  vim hello_world.gw  Add the following lines to print "Hello World" (Note the semicolon at the end)  <<< "Hello World" >>>;  Save and exit the file(:wq in vim). Use the following command to run your first gwion program  ./gwion hello_world.gw  Congratulations!! You ran your first gwion program.  Making Sound  This section is currently very Linux-centric. We are working to improve that. Pull requests welcome!  Gwion relies on plugins for most of its language features, including all those that make sound. Plugins are located in the subdirectories of plug . To get some sounds going under linux using jack sound server, you can build the plugins Jack , Soundpipe , and Modules .  Starting from the Gwion base directory, to build Jack :  cd plug/Jackmake  This will give you a shared object file, Jack.so . The default place Gwion will look for plugins is in a subdir of your home directorynamed .gwplug . So create that directory and move Jack.so there:  mkdir ~/.gwplugmv Jack.so ~/.gwplug  Repeat for the other plugins mentioned. The Soundpipe plugin requires the soundpipe library, which we hope to have build seamlessly for you when you build the Soundpipe module, but we're not quite there yet. Please ask for help if this isn't working.  When all those plugin .so files are in your ~/.gwplug directory, you should be able to run a Gwion program that makes sound! In plug/Modules there's a test.gw program which plays a sine wave for 5 seconds. If the gwion you built is still in the base dir of your cloned repo, from the plug/Modules subdirectory you should be able to run ../../gwion -d Jack test.gw and hear some sound!  Installation  It's a good idea to install Gwion now that you have tried it out. Use the following command to install it  sudo make install  You want to know more? 😄 Look here Both outdated and WIP 👷 but a nice place to learn and contribute  Reporting bugs / Contributing  👍 Every helping hand is welcome!!! 👍  If there's anything you see that can make Gwion better, please let us know!  📖 Please see the contributing page for more information.
