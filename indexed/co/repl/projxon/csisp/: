html CSISP   CSISP â€“ What is it?  CSISP stands for Client-Server Information Share Protocol. It is a protocol that makes it easy for clients and servers to share information between each other. It also allows for server to server and client to client information sharing. This protocol unlike most is not TCP based yet it is fast and effiecient.
