MDR, a markdown runner | mdr   HEADER    View on GitHub  mdr  MDR, the markdown runner    MAIN CONTENT    MDR, a markdown runner      mdr is a small  program and markup designed to facilitate documentation and testing.   I started it to ease Gwion ’s devellopment,but it is not tied in any way to this project.  Let’ walktrough… :smile:  Hello World  let’s write our first litterate progam.  Define program structure   hello_world.c``` hello_world.c @[[ Includes ]]   int main(int argc, char** argv) {  @[[ Print ]]}  ### Add HeadersAs we need the *puts* function, we need **stdio** headers.  &lt; Includes``` Includes  #include &lt;stdio.h&lt;  Print function   Print  puts("Hello, World!");   Compile  let’s compile hello_world.c .   exec: cc hello_world.c -o hello_world     Yes, there should be no output, and that good news.  Check  Let’s look at hello_world.c   exec: cat hello_world.c ```#include   int main(int argc, char** argv) {  puts(“Hello, World!”);}  That's the content of the source file we generated (and compiled).### TestThen we run it  &lt; exec: ./hello_world  Hello, World!  Do we read *Hello World!* ?Assuming yes, let's continue.### More test  &lt; exec: [ "$(./hello_world)" = "Hello, World!" ] && echo "OK" || echo "NOT_OK"  OK  ## BuildingAs a C program, it seemed natural to use [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make)as a build system.``` shmake  Testing  Also using make:  make test   You can also try  bash scripts/test.sh  Installing  As easy as before, just type.  make install   or just copy mdr somewhere in your path.   generated from this file    FOOTER    mdr maintained by fennecdjay  Published with GitHub Pages
